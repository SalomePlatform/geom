\page angle_page Angle

This operation returns the angle in degrees between two lines or linear edges.

If both objects are <b>vectors</b>, the angle is computed in accordance with their orientations, otherwise the minimum angle is computed.

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.GetAngle(shape1, shape2),</em> where
Shape1 and Shape2 are shapes between which the angle is computed. 
Another TUI command is <em>geompy.GetAngleRadians(shape1,shape2),</em> 
which returns the value of angle in radians.
