\page check_self_intersections_page Detect Self-intersections

This operation checks the topology of the selected shape to detect self-intersections.

In this dialog:

- \b Object - the checked object. \b Selection button allows picking it in the viewer or in the object browser.
- <b>Level of check</b> - The combo box that allows to set the level of checking shape on self-interference.
  It defines which interferferences will be checked. Default value is "All interferences".
- <b>Compute self-intersections</b> button computes self-interferences.
- \b Summary section contains the general report if the object has self-intersections and/or if errors are occured during computation.
- \b Self-intersections list contains the list of self-intersections detected.
Select the intersection(s) to show <b>Sub-shapes</b> in the field to the right. 
- \b Apply and <b>Apply and Close</b> buttons are used to store interferences selected in the "Self-intersections" list box in the study for further analysis.
If no any interference is selected, all interferences are published in the study. Each interference is published as a child
compound of the source shape and contains a couple of intersecting sub-shapes.

\note This tool is useful for detection of shapes, not suitable for
arguments of Boolean operations and Partition algorithm.
For more information about Partition and Boolean Operations Algorithms
and their limitations refer to <a href="SALOME_BOA_PA.pdf">this document</a>.

\n <b>Result:</b> Boolean.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.CheckSelfIntersections(theShape, theCheckLevel = GEOM.SI_ALL),</em> \n
where: \n
\em theShape is the shape checked for validity. \n
\em theCheckLevel is the level of check. Default value is GEOM.SI_ALL to check all interferences.
