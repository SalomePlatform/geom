\b Common operation cuts the common part of a list of shapes and transforms it into an independent geometrical object.

To produce it, select in the main menu  <b>Operations - > Boolean - > Common</b>.

\image html bool2.png "Common dialog"

In this dialog:
- Input or accept the default \b Name of the resulting shape. 
- Click the arrow button and select in the Object Browser or in the Viewer the <b>Objects</b> the common part which of should be found.
- Activate the corresponding check-box if you wish to <b> Detect Self-intersections </b>
- Activate \ref restore_presentation_parameters_page "Advanced options" if required.
- Press "Apply" or "Apply & Close" button to get the result (GEOM_Object).


\note This algorithm does not find all types of self-intersections. It is tuned
      to detect vertex/vertex, vertex/edge, edge/edge, vertex/face and edge/face
      intersections. Face/face intersections detection is switched off as it
      is a time-consuming operation that gives an impact on performance. To find
      all self-intersections use \ref check_self_intersections_page
      "Detect Self-intersection tool".
	  
	  
This operation can be performed using a <b>TUI Command:</b> 

<em>geompy.MakeCommonList(theShapesList, checkSelfInte)</em>

<b>Arguments:</b> Name + a list of shapes + an optional flag for self-intersection check.

There is also a special <b>TUI Command</b> for the Common operation on two shapes :

<em>geompy.MakeCommon(s1, s2, checkSelfInte)</em>

<b>Arguments:</b> Name + 2 shapes + an optional flag for self-intersection check.

<b>Example:</b>

\image html commonsn.png "The resulting object"

Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful examples of the use of
\ref tui_common "Boolean Operations".

Please, refer to <a href="SALOME_BOA_PA.pdf">this document</a> for a detailed description of Boolean operations.
It provides a general review of the Partition and Boolean
operations algorithms, describes the usage methodology and highlights
major limitations of these operations.
