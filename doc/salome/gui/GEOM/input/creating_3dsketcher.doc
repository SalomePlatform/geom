3D Sketcher allows creating a closed or unclosed 3D wire from a list of points.

To create a 3D Sketch, select in the main menu <em>New Entity -> 3D Sketch</em>.

The position of each coordinates can be defined by absolute coordinates X, Y, Z or
by relative coordinates DX, DY, DZ with respect to the previous Applied point.
Type of coordinates can be selected by the <b>Coordinates Type</b> radio buttons.
\n <b>"Sketch Validation"</b> button applies the wire, only red part will be built by "Sketch Validation".
\n <b>"Sketch Closure"</b> will close the Sketch by straight line from last red part and apply it. 
To make a closed wire using the TUI command, the first and the last point shoul 
have the same coordinates.

The Result of the operation will be a \b GEOM_Object.

<b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.Make3DSketcher( [ PointsList ] )</em>
This algorithm creates a wire, from the list of real values which define XYZ 
coordinates of points.

<b>Example:</b>
