To create an \b Ellipse in the <b>Main Menu</b> select <b>New Entity - > Basic - > Ellipse</b>

\n You can define an \b Ellipse by its <b>Center</b> point, a \b
Vector giving its normal, another vector specifying the direction of
ellipse's <b>Major Axis</b> and its <b>Major</b> & <b>Minor Radiuses</b>.
\n The \b Result of the operation will be a GEOM_Object (edge).

\note The parameters <b>Center</b>, <b>Vector</b> and <b>Major Axis</b>
are optional. By default it is presumed that the <b>Center</b> point
is located at the origin of the global coordinate system, the \b Vector
corresponds to OZ axis of the global coordinate system and <b>Major Axis</b>
corresponds to OX axis of the global coordinate system.

\note The actual direction of the major axis vector is defined as
<EM> Vmaj' = (Vn * Vmaj) * Vn</em>, where \em Vn is a normal vector and
\em Vmaj is an original vector of the major axis.

\n <b>TUI Command (without the major axis):</b> <em>geompy.MakeEllipse(Point, Vector, RadiusMajor, RadiusMinor)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 vertex (for the center) + 1 edge (for
the direction) + 1 X Radius + 1 Y Radius.

\n <b>TUI Command (with the major axis):</b> <em>geompy.MakeEllipseVec(Point, Vector, RadiusMajor, RadiusMinor, VectorMajor)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 vertex (for the center) + 1 edge (for
the normal direction) + 1 X Radius + 1 Y Radius + 1 edge (for the
major axis direction).
