\page create_explode_page Explode

\n To \b Explode an object into sub-shapes, in the <b>Main Menu</b>
select <b>New Entity > Explode</b>.

\n To create a list of  sub-shapes (vertices, edges, wires etc.) of the
given shape using the \b Explode operation, you need to define the <b>Main
Object</b>, which will be exploded and the <b>Type of Sub-shapes</b> you wish to
obtain from it.
\n The \b Result of the operation will be a List of \b GEOM_Objects
(vertexes, edges, wires, faces, shells or solids).

\n Using <b>TUI Commands</b> you can perform this operation in a
variety of ways:
<ul>
<li><em>geompy.ExtractShapes(Shape, Type, isSorted)</em> explodes a
Shape into sub-shapes of a given Type and returns a List of sub-shapes.
This method does not return the Shape itself if it matches the
Type.</li>
<li><em>geompy.SubShapeAll(Shape, Type)</em> explodes a Shape on
sub-shapes of a given Type and returns a List of sub-shapes.</li>
<li><em>geompy.SubShapeAllIDs(Shape, Type)</em> explodes a Shape on
sub-shapes of a given Type and returns a List of IDs of
sub-shapes.</li>
<li><em>geompy.SubShapeAllSortedCentres(Shape, Type)</em> explodes a
shape on sub-shapes of a given type and sorts them taking into account
their gravity centers, to provide a stable order of sub-shapes.
It returns a list of sub-shapes.</li>
<li><em>geompy.SubShapeAllSortedCentresIDs(Shape, Type)</em> explodes
a shape on sub-shapes of a given type and sorts them taking into
account their gravity centers, to provide a stable order of sub-shapes.
It returns a List of IDs of sub-shapes.</li>
<li><em>geompy.SubShape(Shape, Type, ListOfInd)</em> allows to obtain
a compound of sub-shapes of  the Shape,  selected by they indices in a
list of all sub-shapes of the given Type. Each index is in the range
[1, Nb_Sub-Shapes_Of_Given_Type].</li>
<li><em>geompy.SubShapeSortedCentres(Shape, Type, ListOfInd)</em>
allows to obtain a compound of sub-shapes of the Shape, selected by
they indices in sorted list of all sub-shapes of the given Type. Each
index is in the range [1, Nb_Sub-Shapes_Of_Given_Type]</li>
</ul>

\n <b>Arguments: </b>1 SHAPE + 1 type of SubShape.
