To create a \b Face in the <b>Main Menu</b> select <b>New Entity - >
Build - > Face</b>

There are two algorithms to create a \b Face. In both cases the \b Result
of the operation will be a GEOM_Object (FACE).

\n Firstly, to create a \b Face you need to select input shape(s). The list of
input shapes can include shapes of any type except vertices; if the shapes are
neither wires nor edges, the algorithm extracts all edges from
the input shapes and works on the obtaineed edges.
\n The edges and wires do not necessarily have to be closed, the
algorithm automatically builds a wire of maximum length from all
given edges and wires. If several closed wires are detected the algorithm tries
to create a face with holes. It is possible only if there is only one wire
that can be interpreted as an outer one; other wires can be considered as
inner ones.
\n Check <b>Try to create a planar face</b> to create a planar
face or nothing if it is impossible.
\note Please note, that the resulting face can have a huge tolerance, if the initial wire has a big deviation from the plane. If the final tolerance exceeds 1e-06, a warning will be shown, but the face will be created and published in the study in a normal way. Using such faces can lead to failures or unpredictable results in most operations.

\n The \b Result will be a \b GEOM_Object (FACE).

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeFaceWires([list of Shapes], isPlanarWanted)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 wire.

\n Secondly, it is possible to create a face based on another face's surface and bounded by a wire.

\n The \b Result will be a \b GEOM_Object (FACE).

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeFaceFromSurface(theFace, theWire)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 face + 1 wire.
