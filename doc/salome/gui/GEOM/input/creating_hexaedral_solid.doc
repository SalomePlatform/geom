\page create_hexa_solid_page Hexaedral solid

This operation allows to build a hexahedral solid bypassing
the intermediate stage of building a shell and 4 faces (in case of
building by 2 faces) or just a shell (in case of building by 6
faces).

There are 2 algorithms to create a hexahedral solid in the 3D space.
\n The \b Result of the operation will be a \b GEOM_Object (solid).

Firstly, you can define a Hexahedral Solid by two faces, other four faces are created automatically.

<b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeHexa2Faces(F1, F2),</em> 
<b>Arguments:</b> Name + 2 Faces.

\n <b>Example:</b>

\image html image181.png
<center>Hexahedral Solid built on the base of two Faces</center>

Secondly, you can define a Hexahedral Solid by all six faces.

<b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeHexa(F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6),</em> 
<b>Arguments:</b> Name + 6 Faces.

<center>Hexahedral Solid built on the base of six Faces</center>


The created blocks can be processed with  \ref blocks_operations_page "Operations on Blocks".

Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful examples of
\ref tui_building_by_blocks_page "Building by Blocks".
