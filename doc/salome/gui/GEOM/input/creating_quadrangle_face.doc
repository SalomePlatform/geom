\page create_quadrangle_face_page Quadrangle face

This operation allows to build a face bypassing the
intermediate stage of building edges and wires (in case of
building by 4 points) or wires (in case of building by 4 or 2
edges).

There are 3 algorithms to create a Quadrangle Face in the 3D space.

eration will be a \b GEOM_Object (face).

Firstly you can define a Quadrangle Face by four vertices. Edges are
created automatically.

<b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeQuad4Vertices(V1, V2, V3, V4),</em> 
<b>Arguments:</b> Name + 4 Points.

Secondly, you can define a Quadrangle Face by two edges, while the other two edges are created automatically.
<b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeQuad2Edges(E1, E2)</em>
<b>Arguments:</b> Name + 2 Edges.

Finally, you can define a Quadrangle Face by four edges.

<b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeQuad(E1, E2, E3, E4),</em>.
<b>Arguments:</b> Name + 4 Edges.
