\page create_sketcher_page Sketcher

Sketcher allows to create curves of 2 types: line segment and arc.
By default the start point of the curve is located at the point of
origin of the reference coordinate system and the curve lies in the
plane XOY.  The end of the curve is defined by
means of "destination", which can be a destination point (for segment
only) or destination direction coupled with length of a segment or
angle and radius of an arc.

\n Sketcher is able to create planar curves only. Therefore, it is
necessary to select a working plane before starting a sketch (by
default, XOY plane is used). Sketcher creates curves lying in the
current working plane (New Entity -> Basic -> Working Plane).

\n This functionality is available from the main menu via <em>New
Entity / Sketch</em>.

\n The Result of the operation will be a \b GEOM_Object.

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeSketcher(Command, WorkingPlane)</em>
\n This algorithm creates a sketcher (wire or face), following the
textual description, passed through the Command argument. The edges of
the resulting wire or face will be arcs of circles and/or linear
segments.
\n \em Command is a string, defining the sketcher by the coordinates of
points in the local working plane.
\n <em>WorkingPlane</em> can be a plane or a planar face. The plane is
defined by the XYZ coordinates of three non-coincident points. The
planar face is an existing GEOM_Object.

\n <b>Arguments:</b>
<ol>
<li>Element type (segment or arc).</li>
<li>Destination type (point or direction).</li>
<li>Destination point by means of:</li>
<ul>
<li>absolute coordinates X,Y;</li>
<li>relative coordinates DX, DY (with respect to the current point);</li>
<li>selection of an existing point.</li>
</ul>
<li>Destination direction by means of:</li>
<ul>
<li>angle between the new segment and the previous one;</li>
<li>perpendicular to the previous segment (same as previous, but angle
is predefined and is equal to 90 degrees);</li>
<li>tangent to the previous segment;</li>
<li>vector components DX, DY.</li>
</ul>
<li>Parameters of an element (for segment : length or target X or Y coordinate value, for arc : radius and angle).</li>
</ol>

\b Buttons:

<b>"Sketch Validation"</b> button applies the wire, only red part will be built by "Sketch Validation".
\n <b>"Sketch Closure"</b> will close the Sketch by straight line from last red part and apply it.
