\page cut_operation_page Cut

\b Cut operation cuts a shape with a list of other shapes.

To produce it, select in the main menu <b>Operations - > Boolean - > Cut</b>

\image html bool3.png "Cut dialog"

In this dialog:
- Input or accept the default \b Name of the resulting shape. 
- Click the arrow button and select in the Object Browser or in the Viewer the <b>Main Object</b>, which will be cut by tool objects.
- Select the <b>Tool objects</b>, which will cut the main object.
- Activate the corresponding check-box if you wish to <b> Detect Self-intersections </b>.
- Activate the corresponding check-box if you wish to use a <b> fuzzy parameter </b>.  
  If activated, you can define the fuzzy tolerance in the <b> fuzzy parameter </b> input box.
- Activate \ref restore_presentation_parameters_page "Advanced options" if required.
- Press "Apply" or "Apply & Close" button to get the result (GEOM_Object).

\note This algorithm does not find all types of self-intersections. It is tuned
      to detect vertex/vertex, vertex/edge, edge/edge, vertex/face and edge/face
      intersections. Face/face intersections detection is switched off as it
      is a time-consuming operation that gives an impact on performance. To find
      all self-intersections use \ref check_self_intersections_page
      "Detect Self-intersection tool".

This operation can be performed using a <b>TUI Command:</b> 

<em>geompy.MakeCutList(theMainShape, theShapesList, checkSelfInte, name, fuzzyParam)</em>

<b>Arguments:</b> a main shape + a list of other shapes + an optional flag for self-intersection 
check + an optional name + an optional fuzzy parameter.

There is also a special <b>TUI Command:</b> for the Cut operation on two shapes (object and tool) :

<em>geompy.MakeCut(s1, s2, checkSelfInte, name, fuzzyParam)</em>

<b>Arguments:</b> the object + the tool + an optional flag for self-intersection check + an
optional name + an optional fuzzy parameter.

<b>Example:</b>

\image html cutsn.png "The resulting object"

Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful examples of the use of
\ref tui_cut "Boolean Operations".

Please refer to <a href="SALOME_BOA_PA.pdf">this document</a> for a detailed description of Boolean operations.
It provides a general review of the Partition and Boolean
operations algorithms, describes the usage methodology and highlights
major limitations of these operations.
