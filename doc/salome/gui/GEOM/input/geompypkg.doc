\page geompypkg_page Programming Interface of GEOM python package

Sorry, but the documentation is not available yet in doxygen format.

Fortunately, a documentation exists in restructured format and then
can be generated here using sphinx, in the expectative of the doxygen
version. This documentation is available <a href="../../tui/GEOM/docutils/index.html">
here</a>.

Here is a sample generated from the doxygen format:

The GEOM python package essentially contains:

<ul>
  <li>The visualization of structural elements: a function to create
  geometrical 3D representations of mechanical models called
  "structural elements".
</ul>

For details, you should refer to the complete
<a href="../../tui/GEOM/docutils/index.html"> documentation of the GEOM
python packages</a> generated with sphinx from rst text files.

Note that these functions either encapsulate the python programming
interface of GEOM core (the CORBA or SWIG interfaces for example) or
extend existing utilities as the ``geompy.py`` module.

The functions are distributed in the python package
``salome.geom``. For example, the usage of the visualization of
structural elements can be appreciated with this set of instructions:

\code

   from salome.geom.structelem import TEST_StructuralElement
   TEST_StructuralElement()
\endcode

This creates the geometrical objects displayed in the study below:
