\page modify_location_operation_page Modify the Location

\n To <b>Modify the Location</b> in the <b>Main Menu</b> select 
<b>Operations - > Transformation - > Modify the Location</b>.

\n This operation modifies the \b Location of \b Objects.

\n The first algorithm places the \b Object(s) so that its center coincides
with the origin of the <b>Local Coordinate System</b>. 
\n <b>Create a copy</b> checkbox allows to keep the initial objects, otherwise they
will be removed.
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + one or several objects + End Coordinate System.
\n \ref restore_presentation_parameters_page "Advanced options".

\n In the picture the initial cube with the global coordinate system
is to the right and the modified cube with the Local Coordinate
System in the center of it is to the left .

\n The second algorithm  modifies the location of the \b Object(s) using \b Start
and \b End \b LCS, although the final position of the object will not
coincide with the center of  either of the two systems. In this method
the object is shifted from its initial position by the value of the
remainder after subtraction of the coordinates of the <b>Start LCS</b> from
the coordinates of the <b>End LCS</b>.
\n <b>Create a copy</b> checkbox allows to keep the initial object,
otherwise it will be removed.
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + one or several objects + Start Coordinate System + End
Coordinate System.

In this picture we see the initial cube with the global coordinate
system and two LCS: LocalCS1 (GCS+100 along x-axis) and LocalCS2
(GCS+200 along x-axis)

\image html image1.png

Selecting Start LCS = LCS1 and End LCS = LCS2, we obtain the
translated cube at the position (100;0;0)

\image html image21.png

Selecting Start LCS = LCS2 and End LCS = LCS1, we obtain the
translated cube at the position (-100;0;0)

The third algorithm modifies the location of the \b Object(s) using the <b>Path object</b> (Wire or Edge)
and the \b Distance parameter (ranging from 0 to 1) defining  how far the object will move along the path.
\n <b>Create a copy</b> checkbox allows to keep the initial object,
otherwise it will be removed.
\n <b>Select Unpublished edges</b> checkbox allows to select sub-shape edges on
the other objects.
\n <b>Reverse Direction</b> checkbox allows to REVERSE the direction of the object movement along its path.

<b>Arguments:</b> Name + one or several objects + Translation path.

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakePosition(theObject, theStartLCS,
theEndLCS),</em>  where \em theObject is a shape, location of which is
modified, \em theStartLCS is a location to move the shape from, \em
theEndLCS is a location to move the shape to.

\n Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful examples of the use
of \ref tui_modify_location "Transformation Operations".
