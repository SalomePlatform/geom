\page multi_translation_operation_page Multi Translation

\n To produce a <b>Multi Translation</b> in the <b>Main Menu</b>
select <b>Operations - > Transformation - > Multi Translation</b>

\n This operation makes several translations of a shape in \b one or \b
two directions.
\n The \b Result will be one \b GEOM_Object (compound). The total
number of shape copies in the resulting compound will be equal to:
- in case of \ref single_multi_translation "Single multi translation":
\a NbTimes (if \a NbTimes parameter is equal to 1, the result will
contain only the initial non-translated shape). 
- in case of \ref double_multi_translation "Double multi translation":
\a NbTimes1 x \a NbTimes2 (if \a NbTimes1 and \a NbTimes2 parameters
are both equal to 1, the result will contain a single non-translated
initial shape). 

\anchor single_multi_translation
\n To produce a <b>Simple Multi Translation</b> (in one direction) you
need to indicate an \b Object to be translated, a \b Vector of
translation (DX by default), a \b Step of translation and a <b>Number
of Times</b> the Object should be duplicated. If a curve has been
selected instead of the Vector, only its first and last vertices will
be used to get the vector direction and the dialog preview will
display the vector along which the object will be translated.

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeMultiTranslation1D(Shape, Dir,
Step, NbTimes)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 shape + 1 vector (for direction) + 1
step value + 1 value (repetition).

\anchor double_multi_translation
\n To produce a <b>Double Multi Translation</b> (in two directions) you need to
indicate an \b Object to be translated, and, for both axes, a \b
Vector of translation (DX and DY by default), a \b Step of translation
and a <b>Number of Times</b> the shape must be duplicated.
If a curve has been selected instead of the Vector, only its first and
last vertices will be used to get the vector direction and the dialog
preview will display the vector along which the object will be
translated.

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeMultiTranslation2D(Shape, Dir1,
Step1, NbTimes1, Dir2, Step2, NbTimes2),</em> where \em Shape is a shape
to be translated, \em Dir1 is the first direction of translation, \em Step1 of
the first translation, \em NbTimes1 is a number of translations to be done
along \em Dir1, \em Dir2 is the second direction of translation, \em Step2 of the
second translation, \em NbTimes2 is a number of translations to be done
along \em Dir2.
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + 1 shape + 2 vectors defining the direction
+ 2 step values + 2 values (repetitions).

Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful examples of the use of
\ref tui_multi_translation "Transformation Operations".
