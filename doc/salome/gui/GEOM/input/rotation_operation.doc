\n To produce a \b Rotation in the <b>Main Menu</b> select 
<b>Operations - > Transformation - > Rotation</b>

\n This operation \b rotates the initial shape.

\n The first \b Rotation algorithm needs you to define an \b Object to
be rotated, an \b Axis of rotation and an \b Angle of rotation.
\n \b Reverse checkbox allows to specify the direction of rotation.
\n <b>Create a copy</b> checkbox allows to keep the initial object,
otherwise it will be removed.
\n \ref restore_presentation_parameters_page "Advanced options".

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeRotation(Shape, Axis, Angle)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + one or several objects + 1 vector for direction of rotation + 1 angle.

\n The second algorithm allows to define the rotated \b Object by
three points. Rotation axis will pass through the <b>Central Point</b>
and will be will be orthogonal to a plane defned by three points. In
this case rotation \b Angle is the angle between two vectors directed
from the  <b>Central Point</b> to \b Point1 and \b Point2.
\n \b Reverse checkbox allows to specify the direction of rotation.
\n <b>Create a copy</b> checkbox allows to keep the initial object,
otherwise it will be removed.

\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeRotationThreePoints(Shape, CentralPoint, Point1, Point2)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> 1 shape + 3 points.


\n <b>Example:</b>

Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful examples of the use of
