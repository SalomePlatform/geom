\n To produce a \b Translation in the <b>Main Menu</b> select
<b>Operations - > Transformation - > Translation</b>

This Operation makes a translation of an \b Object. To translate a
shape you need to define the base shape and the coordinates of the
vector of translation. 
\n <b>Create a copy</b> checkbox allows to keep the initial object, otherwise it will be removed. 
\n \ref restore_presentation_parameters_page "Advanced options".
\n The \b Result of all operations will be any \b GEOM_Object.

The \b Vector of translation can be defined in three different ways selectable using the radio buttons. 

\n Firstly you can define the \b Vector by coordinates along the
axes.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeTranslation(Shape, DX, DY,
DZ),</em> where Shape is a shape to be translated, DX, DY, DZ are
components of translation vector.
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + one or several objects + 3 values (coordinates).

\n Secondly you can define the \b Vector by the start and the end points.
\n <b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeTranslationTwoPoints(Object, Point1, Point2)</em>
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + one or several objects + 2 vertices

\n Finally you can define the \b Vector explicitely. The \b Object will be translated by the length of the vector. 
If a curve has been selected instead of the vector, only its first and last vertices will be used to get the vector direction and the dialog preview will display the vector along which the object will be translated. 
\n <b>Activate Distance</b> checkbox and <b>Distance</b> field allow defining a custom distance of translation.


\n <b>TUI Command:</b> for translation by vector: <em>geompy.MakeTranslationVector(Object, Vector)</em>
\n <b>TUI Command </b> for translation by vector and a custom distance: <em>geompy.MakeTranslationVectorDistance(Object, Vector, Distance)</em> 
\n <b>Arguments:</b> Name + one or several objects + 1 vector.

Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful examples of the use of
