## @defgroup proximity ShapeProximity - tool to check the proximity distance between two shapes
#  @{ 
#  @details
#  The tool provides the user a possibility to compute the proximity distance between two shapes:
#  * a minimal diameter of a tube containing both edges (for edge-edge proximity);
#  * a minimal thickness of a shell containing both faces (for face-face proximity).
#
#  In other words, this tool calculate maximal of all possible distances between pair of objects.
#  It is supported to compute distance between two edges or between two faces.
#  Other combinations of shapes are prohibited.
